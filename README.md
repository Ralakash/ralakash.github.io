# PortfolioProject
This is the portfolio project for challenge assignment 2

##PortfolioProject is a website that shows off my porfolio in a website that I designed.

This was the challenge project 2 for the MSU Coding Bootcamp. 
This project was built to explore the more advanced features of HTML and CSS without using Javascript.
This project allows for me to explore what I have learned over the last four weeks and put it together into a working website that shows off my portfolio.
During this project I was able to explore the limits and functions of CSS Flexbox and was able to learn more about how to use formating of HTML to make CSS easier to use.

## Installation

No instalation is required.

## Usage

One hover attribute is used to expand the list of works and allow for a drop down list under "My Works".

## Credits

This was completed with the knowledge gained over the last 4 weeks of bootcamp as well as help from the TA's and instructor.
